### Overview

This FHIR Implementation Guide provides a set of profiles for generating Adverse Event case reports related to biologic products, such as vaccines and blood products.  There are two sets of profiles.  The first set of profiles are intended to provide value sets of codes for detecting specific conditions and observations on a patient's record that would indicate the occurrence of an Adverse Event.  The second set of profiles provides mappings to the ICH ICSR specifications, specifically FDA's FAERS and VAERS implementations of those specifications.
