<h3><a name="ICSR Mappings"></a>Mappings from ICSR Specifications to FHIR</h3>
<p>Two sets of mappings were created from the FDA ICSR Specifications. The FAERS mappings were done using FDA's FAERS R2 Implementation Guide and mapping the specified elements to the FHIR Profiles in this guide.  The VAERS mappings where done using both the ICH ICSR R3 Implementation Guide and FDA's VAERS Regional Guide.</p>
<p>The mappings were expressed in an <a href="ICSR_Field_Listing_and_FHIR_Mapping.xlsx">Excel spreadsheet</a>.</p>
<p>Samples used at the January 2021 Connectathon provide the <a href="FAERS_EXAMPLE.xml">FAERS</a> and <a href="FAERS_EXAMPLE.xml">VAERS</a> XML formats as well as the converted FHIR Bundles that correspond to those samples (<a href="Bundle-ConnectathonFAERSBundle.html">FAERS FHIR Bundle</a> and <a href="Bundle-ConnectathonVAERSBundle.html">VAERS FHIR Bundle</a>).</p>
