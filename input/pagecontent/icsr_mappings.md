<h3><a name="ICSR Mappings"></a>Mappings from ICSR Specifications to FHIR</h3>
<p>As part of this IG, FAERS and VAERS mappings were created from the FDA ICSR Specifications:
  1. FAERS: Mappings were created using the FDA FAERS R2 IG and mapping the specified elements to the FHIR Profiles in this guide.  
  2. VAERS: Mappings were created using both the ICH ICSR R3 IG and the FDA VAERS Regional Guide.</p>
<p>The mappings were expressed in this <a href="ICSR_Field_Listing_and_FHIR_Mapping.xlsx">Excel spreadsheet</a>.</p>
<p>Samples used at the January 2021 Connectathon provide the <a href="FAERS_EXAMPLE.xml">FAERS</a> and <a href="VAERS_EXAMPLE.xml">VAERS</a> XML formats as well as the converted FHIR Bundles that correspond to those samples (<a href="Bundle-ConnectathonFAERSBundle.html">FAERS FHIR Bundle</a> and <a href="Bundle-ConnectathonVAERSBundle.html">VAERS FHIR Bundle</a>).</p>
