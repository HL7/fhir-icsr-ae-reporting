  "title": "Profiles for ICSR Transfusion and Vaccination Adverse Event Detection and Reporting",
  "introduction": "This FHIR Implementation Guide details a process where adverse event (AE) individual case safety reports (ICSR) are generated from EHR data. There are two main components to this process: detection and reporting. To support AE detection, this IG includes a set of Clinical Quality Language (CQL) algorithms which can be run on FHIR data. To support AE reporting, this IG includes a set of profiles that enables the creation of a FHIR-based ICSR report and mappings to ICH ICSR specification (FAERS and VAERS implementation of those specifications). This work was developed as part of the FDAâ€™s Center for Biologic Evaluation and Research (CBER) Biologics Effectiveness and Safety (BEST) initiatve. This IG currently focuses on post-vaccination and post-tranfusion AE reporting.",
